	<description>
		The ability to set a class name for a button can be useful both for styling the button and also for selection and manipulation via the API (`b-api buttons()` for example). This option provides exactly that ability.

		The class name defined here is added to the class name defined by `-feature buttons.buttons.className`, so the button will likely have two or more class names assigned to it.

		Please note that most buttons will define their own class name so they will be style-able without being required to add a custom class name using you are extending an existing button. Please refer to the documentation for each button type for their default class name.

		Additionally, if you extend a button that has its own class name defined, any classes you set will automatically be appended to the extended button's class. It will _not_ overwrite the original class.
