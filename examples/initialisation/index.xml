Buttons is an unimaginatively named library that provides buttons for DataTables. Simple, single click buttons can be useful when used in combination with a table providing end users with the ability to interact with the table. This can take the form of exporting data, controlling column visibility, triggering an editing action or activating any other custom method you wish to use.

The set of examples available here show how Buttons can be initialised and the basics of how to use it.
